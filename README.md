# aOS
 Aadithya's Operating System --v1.0.0
 
Currently runs in 32-bit mode on x86 architecture.

It is limited in its functionality. Currently only boots using grub and prints limited information to the raster buffer/screen.

Recommended to run the release image on an emulator such as QEMU although it can be booted on bare metal.
Run> qemu-system-x86_64.exe -boot d os.iso -m 32768
